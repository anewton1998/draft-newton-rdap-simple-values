                 draft-newton-rdap-simple-values-latest

Abstract

   This document defines an extension for the Registration Data Access
   Protocol to express simple values for scenarios where specific data
   is needed, but the format of the data is not complicated enough to
   require a specific extension for that data.

1.  Introduction

   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) defines a core set of
   data types for Domain Name Registries (DNRs) and Internet Number
   Resource Registries (INRRs) as defined in [RFC9083].  When a registry
   needs to express data not found in [RFC9083], an RDAP extension must
   be used for the expression of that data.  However, RDAP extensions
   require changes to client software to be useful by most users.  For
   scenarios in which the data is not complex, this can be overly
   burdensome.

   This RDAP extension defines a method for the expression of simple
   values that is reusable across multiple use cases.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Simple Value Data

   This RDAP extension defines a JSON object of the following form:

   json "simpleValues_data" : [ { "name" : "example", "value" : "the
   data", "scope" : "some scope", "links" : [ ... (links from RFC 9083)
   ] } ]

   This JSON object contains an array of name/value JSON objects, each
   with the following members:

   *  "name" - a string containing the registered name of the value.

   *  "value" - depending on the registration of the name, this is one
      of the following data types:

      -  a JSON boolean

      -  a JSON number

      -  a JSON string

      -  an array of JSON booleans

      -  an array of JSON numbers

      -  an array of JSON strings

   *  "scope" - an OPTIONAL string to distinguish a specific use of the
      value.

   *  "links" - as defined in [RFC9083].

   Each object of the array MUST only appear once per combination of
   "name" and "scope".  As "scope" is optional, an object of the array
   without a scope MUST only appear once with a "name".

   The "simpleValues_data" object MUST only appear at the top-level of
   an RDAP object class instance.

   The following is an example of an RDAP "ip network" object with a
   "simpleValues_data" object:

   { "rdapConformance" : [ "rdap_level_0", "simpleValues" ],
   "objectClassName" : "ip network", "handle" : "203.0.113.0 -
   203.0.113.255", "ipVersion" : "v4", "startAddress" : "203.0.113.0",
   "endAddress" : "203.0.113.255", "simpleValue_data" : [ { "name" : "ip
   announce auth key pem", "value" : [ "---BEGIN KEY---",
   "349390202000020", "---END KEY---" ], "scope" : "cloud provider
   alpha" }, { "name" : "ip announce auth key pem", "value" : [ "---
   BEGIN KEY---", "abcdefghijklmno", "---END KEY---" ], "scope" : "cloud
   provider gamma" }, ] }

4.  Security Considerations

5.  IANA Considerations
